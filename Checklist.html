    <p>' Thank you for the opportunity to be your agent - and remember that I’m [<em>Agent Name</em>] with SelectQuote.  You should probably write that down because we’ll be your contact if you have any questions or concerns about your plan.  In fact, here’s the number for our SelectQuote Customer Care Team: <b>855-359-3489</b>. They will call you in the next couple of days and reach out to you throughout the year to answer any questions that you might have. As I mentioned, SelectQuote is your one-stop-shop for all of your insurance needs so we can save you time and money with one call. </p> 
    
    <p> The next step will be to get you to a SelectQuote licensed enrollment specialist who will fill out your application and send it to the carrier, this process takes about 20 minutes. During the enrollment you will have to repeat some of the information that you have already provided me with, this is to ensure that our records are accurate. At one point the enrollment specialist will ask you to call them back on an inbound call so you will want to have a pen ready to write down their phone number.</p> 
    
    <p> It's also important that you know you will be required to select a payment option even if your plan costs $0, this is standard on all plans. '</p>

    <p>' The biggest compliment you can give me is a referral to family and friends.  SelectQuote will make sure to provide them outstanding service.  We are licensed throughout the US so your referrals don’t have to be limited to just your state.  Please feel free to share the number I gave you with family and friends. '</p>

    <p>' Keep in mind we also help our customers with their DVH needs as well as accident policies from Aflac.  Most Medicare recipients love these coverage options and add them to their policies for total protection: I will have a specialist from the SelectQuote [<em>dental/vision/hearing</em>] team contact you once your enrollment is complete.
